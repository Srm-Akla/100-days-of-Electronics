# Rules of the 100 Days Of Electronics Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will do an electronics project for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
19 october 2020 [PUT YOUR DATE HERE]

## Additional Rules
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read [FAQ](FAQ.md))


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason feel free to ask
3. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
